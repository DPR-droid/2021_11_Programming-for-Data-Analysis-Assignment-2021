# Assignment Statement

Create a Jupyter notebook explaining the use of the package, including detailed explanations of at least five of the distributions provided for in the package

There are four distinct tasks to be carried out in your Jupyter notebook.
1. Explain the overall purpose of the package.
2. Explain the use of the “Simple random data” and “Permutations” functions.
3. Explain the use and purpose of at least five “Distributions” functions.
4. Explain the use of seeds in generating pseudorandom numbers.

# Notes

This README only contains an explanation on how to run the Jupyter notebook. The Jupyter notebook contains the main body of work and list all references used the in the assignment.

The Jupyter notebook uses NumPy v1.21 Manual for references, this is important for the user to understand as the documentation is changing and updating.

# Steps

- Create github repository 
- Clone github repository 
- Create numpy-random.ipynb
- Commit changes regulary to repository
